### Readme

This is the repository for my personal website. It uses the hugo coder theme and is created with blogdown. 

It is served via Netlify.

### Notes to self

- If working in markdown, place images into the `static/images` folder, and then refer to them via `../../filename.png` in the blog post.
- Run `blogdown::serve_site()` to test the deployment locally, and `blogdown::build_site()` when you're ready to push up to github. 
- You can group things into "tags" and "series".
