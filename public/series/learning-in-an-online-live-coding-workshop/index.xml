      <description>I will be presenting a talk about &amp;ldquo;Jumping into digital: Lessons learned while moving live-coding workshops online&amp;rdquo; at the ARDC community webinar series. You can sign up here.
This is the abstract of my talk:
At ResBaz 2019, I said (on camera) that it is impossible to run a hands-on, live-coding digital skills training workshop online. In March 2020, I led a team of trainers to do exactly this - move our 2-day, Carpentries-style, hands-on Machine Learning in R and Machine Learning in python workshops fully online - in a week!</description>

      <description>With the advent of COVID-19 we’re all having to do the unthinkable, which for an instructor like me means moving hands-on, practical coding workshops online. I&amp;rsquo;ve already written a post with a student-facing map of the process (and some tips for students), but I wanted to focus on a few instructor-related aspects of the map in this post.
My personal teaching setup   I&amp;rsquo;m incredibly lucky to have access to several machines, which I use to work through materials on all of the platforms and also while teaching.</description>

      <description>With the advent of COVID-19 we’re all having to do the unthinkable, which for an instructor like me means moving hands-on, practical coding workshops online. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll provide a map that helped me formalise how I broke down our workshops into components, and tried to map each of them to an online tool, platform or approach. I&amp;rsquo;ve used Zoom for most of the examples below, since that&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ve used for teaching, but I&amp;rsquo;m sure that most of this functionality is well supported by other online meeting tools.</description>

      <description>With the advent of COVID-19 we’re all having to do the unthinkable, which for an instructor like me means moving hands-on, practical coding workshops online. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll outline a few key things you can do as a learner to have what is hopefully the best possible experience attending synchronous online training.
1. Follow your instructor&amp;rsquo;s instructions Install all the things - and test them First and foremost, triple-check that you have installed everything your instructor has suggested, and tested - as much as you know how to - that it works.</description>
