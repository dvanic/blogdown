      <title>Living dangerously: a newbie guide to running multiple version of R on a Mac</title>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;d have to be living under a rock in the R community to not be aware of the fact that R 4.0 has been released, with some major changes, the biggest of which is probably the new default for read.table(): stringsAsFactors = FALSE, as well as the fact that matrix() now converts character columns to factors and factors to integers.
In the past, I&amp;rsquo;ve always been too &amp;ldquo;chicken&amp;rdquo; to try running multiple versions of R on my work laptop, as I&amp;rsquo;ve usually got a few key analysis projects going that need to be delivered on time and within full feature scope - which means I don&amp;rsquo;t have time to fix basic version incompatibility bugs.</description>

      <title>Jumping into digital: Lessons learned while moving live-coding workshops online</title>

      <description>I presented a talk about &amp;ldquo;Jumping into digital: Lessons learned while moving live-coding workshops online&amp;rdquo; at the ARDC community webinar series in April 2020.
The abstract of my talk was:
At ResBaz 2019, I said (on camera) that it is impossible to run a hands-on, live-coding digital skills training workshop online. In March 2020, I led a team of trainers to do exactly this - move our 2-day, Carpentries-style, hands-on Machine Learning in R and Machine Learning in python workshops fully online - in a week!</description>

      <description>With the advent of COVID-19 weâ€™re all having to do the unthinkable, which for an instructor like me means moving hands-on, practical coding workshops online. I&amp;rsquo;ve already written a post with a student-facing map of the process (and some tips for students), but I wanted to focus on a few instructor-related aspects of the map in this post.
My personal teaching setup   I&amp;rsquo;m incredibly lucky to have access to several machines, which I use to work through materials on all of the platforms and also while teaching.</description>

      <description>With the advent of COVID-19 weâ€™re all having to do the unthinkable, which for an instructor like me means moving hands-on, practical coding workshops online. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll provide a map that helped me formalise how I broke down our workshops into components, and tried to map each of them to an online tool, platform or approach. I&amp;rsquo;ve used Zoom for most of the examples below, since that&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ve used for teaching, but I&amp;rsquo;m sure that most of this functionality is well supported by other online meeting tools.</description>

      <description>With the advent of COVID-19 weâ€™re all having to do the unthinkable, which for an instructor like me means moving hands-on, practical coding workshops online. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll outline a few key things you can do as a learner to have what is hopefully the best possible experience attending synchronous online training.
1. Follow your instructor&amp;rsquo;s instructions Install all the things - and test them First and foremost, triple-check that you have installed everything your instructor has suggested, and tested - as much as you know how to - that it works.</description>

      <title>R for Data Science Day 1</title>

      <description>I am incredibly excited that RStudio has begun an instructor certification program based on the Carpentries, so of course I signed up as soon as my overcommited nature allowed! This also provides me with the excuse and motivation to finally formally work my way through R for Data Science, a book I have read while waiting for GTT tests during my pregnancy and google-landed upon an umpteen number of times while debugging code, but never taken the time to sit down and do the exercises for - and of course the pedagogue in me knows quite well that THAT is how you actually learn and internalise the principles and concepts in any material, especially if it deals with programming and analysis.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m finally making the leap, and (hopefully) moving this website to blogdown + hugo + gitlab + netlify.
So far, useful resources for wrapping my head around how to do this:

      <description>On October 24th I attented a talk by Adrian White about using Amazon AWS for research. Below are my notes, not extensively annotated, in the hope that they&amp;rsquo;ll be useful for someone. If something is not clear, please ask in the comments, and I&amp;rsquo;ll try to answer to the best of my knowledge
