      <description>I am incredibly excited that RStudio has begun an instructor certification program based on the Carpentries, so of course I signed up as soon as my overcommited nature allowed! This also provides me with the excuse and motivation to finally formally work my way through R for Data Science, a book I have read while waiting for GTT tests during my pregnancy and google-landed upon an umpteen number of times while debugging code, but never taken the time to sit down and do the exercises for - and of course the pedagogue in me knows quite well that THAT is how you actually learn and internalise the principles and concepts in any material, especially if it deals with programming and analysis.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m finally making the leap, and (hopefully) moving this website to blogdown + hugo + gitlab + netlify.
So far, useful resources for wrapping my head around how to do this:

      <description>On October 24th I attented a talk by Adrian White about using Amazon AWS for research. Below are my notes, not extensively annotated, in the hope that they&amp;rsquo;ll be useful for someone. If something is not clear, please ask in the comments, and I&amp;rsquo;ll try to answer to the best of my knowledge

      <description>As part of a project for work, I needed to port some R machine learning code to python. We weren&amp;rsquo;t trying to achieve 100% identity of results, instead opting to try to implement things &amp;ldquo;natively&amp;rdquo; to the language, and&amp;hellip;
The rsample package has the
initial_split(data, prop = 3/4, strata = NULL, ...)
function has the strata argument, which allows us to select which variable to stratify with. If this variable is categorical, porting the code to python is easy, as we would use</description>
