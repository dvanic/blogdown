      <description>I am incredibly excited that RStudio has begun an instructor certification program based on the Carpentries, so of course I signed up as soon as my overcommited nature allowed! This also provides me with the excuse and motivation to finally formally work my way through R for Data Science, a book I have read while waiting for GTT tests during my pregnancy and google-landed upon an umpteen number of times while debugging code, but never taken the time to sit down and do the exercises for - and of course the pedagogue in me knows quite well that THAT is how you actually learn and internalise the principles and concepts in any material, especially if it deals with programming and analysis.</description>

So far, useful resources for wrapping my head around how to do this:
 Alison Presmanes Hill&amp;rsquo;s documentation Very useful gotcha for configuring Netlify Non-blogdown specific very detailed outlined (for future reference, when I want to add new page types)  Things that don&amp;rsquo;t seem to work:

      <description>I presented a talk on Big data biology for pythonistas: getting in on the genomics revolution at PyCon Au 2016.
In the abstract, I promised the following:
  In 2001 Bill Clinton unveiled &amp;ldquo;the most important, most wondrous map ever produced by humankind&amp;rdquo; - the human genome. This monumental endeavour cost \$3 billion, and took hundreds of scientists from all over the world 13 years. Today, a single person can generate such a map in ~2 days for $1000.</description>
