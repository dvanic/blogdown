        <p>With the advent of COVID-19 we’re all having to do the unthinkable, which for an instructor like me means moving hands-on, practical coding workshops online. In this post, I&rsquo;ll outline a few key things you can do as a <strong>learner</strong> to have what is hopefully the best possible experience attending synchronous online training.</p>
<h3 id="1-follow-your-instructors-instructions">1. Follow your instructor&rsquo;s instructions</h3>
<h4 id="install-all-the-things---and-test-them">Install all the things - and test them</h4>
<p>First and foremost, triple-check that you have installed <em>everything</em> your instructor has suggested, and tested - as much as you know how to - that it works. There are a plethora of online learning tools and platforms out there, and chances are that your instructor would have told you to install a whole bunch of stuff. For example, we use Zoom, Google Docs, and Microsoft Teams in addition to the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; R + packages/python + libraries in our classes! - that&rsquo;s a lot of stuff to install and set up!</p>
<h4 id="versions-matter">Versions matter!</h4>
<p>Make sure you check which versions of particular tools or software packages your instructors need you to have. Note: it&rsquo;s almost always prudent to update to the <em>latest</em> ones, since this is often what your instructors will test with (unless they have <em>explicitly</em> specified not to!).</p>
<h4 id="dont-panic---let-your-instructor-know-asap">Don&rsquo;t panic - let your instructor know ASAP</h4>
<p>If you have an older machine, can&rsquo;t update some packages OR are getting errors:</p>
<ol>
<li>Don&rsquo;t panic!</li>
<li>Google the error: solve it if you can, or copy the links to the top hits if the proposed solutions make no sense to you.</li>
<li>Let your instructors/TAs know as soon as possible, for example via email. Attach a screenshot of the error, and a link to any google stuff you found - this will help them solve the problem faster.</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re working on an older machine and can&rsquo;t get the things you need working: if you email them your instructors will know in advance. This means they may be able to provide you with access to Google Colab or RStudio Cloud or another platform, where you are likely to be able to do most if not all of the things - but these require advanced setup, so it&rsquo;s very helpful to give your instructor a heads up!</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="2-setup-and-test">2. Setup and test</h3>
<h4 id="use-headphones-with-a-mic-if-you-can">Use headphones with a mic (if you can)</h4>
<p>If at all possible, try to use a pair of USB or bluetooth headphones, ideally with a built-in mic (less essential), over trying to talk and especially listen over computer audio. Working from home for the past week, I&rsquo;ve had countless occasions of chatty operators of deafening leaf blowers, friendly neighbors who speak to each other over three fences, and crying toddlers (my contribution to the fray) - all during important meetings where I needed to hear and occasionally speak. My in-ear Apple Airpods were a lifesaver - and my older wired headphones would have worked just as well! Wearing noise cancelling headphones OVER Airpods was my personal lifehack against that leafblower - although remember that this affects the mic if you need to speak!</p>
<h4 id="use-two-screens-if-you-can">Use two screens (if you can)</h4>
<p>In a workshop that involves live coding you&rsquo;ll want to have you instructor&rsquo;s video open as well as someplace on your local machine that you&rsquo;re following along and reproducing their code. In the case of R and python this can be especially challenging, as you&rsquo;d normally want to use and IDE like RStudio or the Jupyter notebook or VSCode, all of which take <em>a lot</em> of screen real estate. Your instructor may also be using one of these IDEs for teaching, which means if you shrink their video too much you won&rsquo;t be able to see what you&rsquo;re typing! So if at all possible - use two screeens: one for video, and one for coding.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have a secondary monitor, there are a few things you can still do. First, you can use a tablet, such as an iPad, or even a mobile phone (if it has a big screen) to show your instructor&rsquo;s video, as you code along on your primary machine. This will be especially helpful if you&rsquo;ve got a small-screen laptop. Second, you can tweak some settings in your video conferencing tool of choice (I&rsquo;ll provide instructions for Zoom, but from what I&rsquo;ve seen of Cisco Webex, Microsoft Teams and other tools, most of this applies) too:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t</strong> enter full-screen by default when joining a meeting. You can configure this in the soom Settings tab. This will allow you to have your instructor&rsquo;s video on 1/2 of your screen, and your own code on the other half.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="../../2003_zoomsettingsGeneral.png" alt="General Zoom Settings"></p>
<ol start="2">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Most online meeting tools - which we&rsquo;re currently using for training - allow you to test your setup. I&rsquo;ll show how to do this in Zoom, which is what we use, but I&rsquo;m sure other apps are similar (leave a comment if you&rsquo;re unsure how to test your app, and I&rsquo;ll give it a go!).</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Zoom, connect your headphones and microphone</li>
</ol>
