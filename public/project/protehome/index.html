<ul>
<li>A large 50+ person laboratory from the University of Sydney&rsquo;s Faculty of Medicine &amp; Health.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
<ul>
<li>To develop a software tool to store their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry">mass spectrometry</a> data.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li>Data exists in spreadsheets on users laptops, with columns organised in various ad-hoc, manual ways</li>
<li>Data can come from several distinct experiment types, with different &ldquo;columns&rdquo; being appropriate for each</li>
<li>Data has been processed with different versions of the same software, and this needs to be recorded/captured</li>
<li>Data has been processed to different versions of reference annotations, so old data needs to be automatically updated to reflect the changes that have happened in the annotation</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="approach">Approach</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>My role was project management &amp; user requirements elucidation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tool ended up consisting of:</p>
<ul>
<li>An interface to upload data and validate its integrity</li>
<li>Internal functionality to update the database records when <a href="https://www.uniprot.org/">UniProt</a> (a publically available annotation database) was updated</li>
<li>A search interface</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="outcome">Outcome</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As project manager, I ensured client needs were met within a reasonable time frame and the software was able to do what they wanted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As domain matter expert, I served as a &ldquo;translator&rdquo; between the clients (biologists) and the two software engineers, as the ways/langauge of describing functionality and user needs was very different between the two. For example, a &ldquo;UI&rdquo; demonstration was confusing for the client, as much core functionality was still not operational, so it was unclear what they were being asked to provide feedback for.</p>
