      <title>Moving Machine Learning from R to python</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of a project for work, I needed to port some R machine learning code to python. We weren&amp;rsquo;t trying to achieve 100% identity of results, instead opting to try to implement things &amp;ldquo;natively&amp;rdquo; to the language, and&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rsample package has the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;initial_split(data, prop = 3/4, strata = NULL, ...)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;function has the strata argument, which allows us to select which variable to stratify with. If this variable is categorical, porting the code to python is easy, as we would use&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split(*arrays, **options)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the variable is numerical, it&amp;rsquo;s harder to figure out what rsample is doing by default. There is, however, a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;make_strata(x, nunique = 5, pool = 0.15, depth = 20)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;function, which most likely is operating with the same principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The help for this states that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For numeric data, if the number of unique levels is less than nunique, the data are treated as categorical data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For categorical inputs, the function will find levels of x than occur in the data with percentage less than pool. The values from these groups will be randomly assigned to the remaining strata (as will data points that have missing values in x). (i.e. by default, categories that represent less than 15% of the dataset will be pooled before sampling happens)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For numeric data with more unique values than nunique, the data will be converted to being categorical based on percentiles of the data. The percentile groups will have no more than 20 percent of the data in each group. Again, missing values in x are randomly assigned to groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am assuming this 20% is being specified by the depth parameter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to replicate this in python for numeric data seems to be to create a &amp;ldquo;dummy&amp;rdquo; variable, which will contain the quartiles as factors, and then to stratify using that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pd.qcut(ameshousingClean[&amp;lsquo;Sale_Price&amp;rsquo;], 10, labels=range(10))&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Moving Machine Learning from R to python</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Vaccine efficacy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is it measured?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is the conf int calculated?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IRR stands for incidence rate ratio&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sample vaccine efficacy can be defined as 1 - IRR = 1 - (cv/nv)/(cp/np)
nv/np - subjects in each group
cp/cv - subjects that got the disease&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The press release stated that so far 38955 subjects got the two doses of the vaccine or placebo of which 94 subjects fell ill with Covid-19. Furthermore, the study plan stated that the same number of subjects was assigned to the treatment and control group and letâ€™s assume that also in the 38955 subjects analysed so far the ratio is almost equal. An efficacy of at least 90% then implies that from the 94 subjects with Covid-19 at most 8 could have been vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
