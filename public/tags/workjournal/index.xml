      <description>You&amp;rsquo;d have to be living under a rock in the R community to not be aware of the fact that R 4.0 has been released, with some major changes, the biggest of which is probably the new default for read.table(): stringsAsFactors = FALSE, as well as the fact that matrix() now converts character columns to factors and factors to integers.
In the past, I&amp;rsquo;ve always been too &amp;ldquo;chicken&amp;rdquo; to try running multiple versions of R on my work laptop, as I&amp;rsquo;ve usually got a few key analysis projects going that need to be delivered on time and within full feature scope - which means I don&amp;rsquo;t have time to fix basic version incompatibility bugs.</description>
