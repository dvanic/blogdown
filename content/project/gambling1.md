## Project overview

- Integrated 12+ million online wagering transactions from 50 000 clients of 6 major online wagering operators, co-writing the first academic publication & a report for Responsible Wagering Australia on customer protection tool use among Australian online wagerers. Engineered over 200 features for analysis.
- This revealed that mandatory vs opt-in deposit limits are likely to reduce the risk of harms, so was covered by media worldwide.
- *Key tools: R: data.table, tidyverse, Rmarkdown, lubridate, gtsummary, tidyquant, lmertest, broom; Git + GitHub*.
