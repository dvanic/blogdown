## Project overview

- Integrating 20 years of records from the manually curated OMIA database into the international European Variant Archive (EVA), including resolving issues resulting from manual data entry. 
- I was the only person with both software and biology experience on the team, so this project involved substantial communication mediation. 
- Records have been standardised (last bugfixes happening now) and will be part of the next EVA release.

- *Key tools: git & GitHub; GitHub projects; Jira; Trello.*
