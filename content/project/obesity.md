## Project summary

- Resolved encoding issues in a corpus of 27 000+ articles about obesity from 12 Australian newspapers.
- Implemented near-duplicate detection, visualisation and removal using minhash and locality-sensitive hashing ("reimplemented Turnitin in Python") to ensure subsequent statistical analyses were not invalid due to duplicates.
- Used topic modelling to create sub-corpora for further analysis.
- Translated analytics spreadsheets used by researchers to a standalone Python script, automating and scaling one-vs-all and one-vs-one sub-corpus analysis.
- Provided comprehensive client-interpretable documentation.
- *Key tools: Python: pandas, chardet, spacy, seaborn, gensim, datasketch; Git + GitHub; Jira; fdupes*.
