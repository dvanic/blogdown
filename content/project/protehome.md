## Project aims

To develop a software tool for a large 50+ person unit to store their [mass spectrometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry) data.

This tool consisted of:

- An interface to upload data and validate its integrity
- Internal functionality to update the database records when UniProt (a publically available annotation database) was updated
- A search interface


## Key challenges

- Data exists in spreadsheets on users laptops, with columns organised in various ad-hoc, manual ways
- Data can come from several distinct experiment types, with different "columns" being appropriate for each
- Data has been processed with different versions of the same software, and this needs to be recorded/captured
- Data has been processed to different versions of reference annotations, so old data needs to be automatically updated to reflect the changes that have happened in the annotation

## My role

- Project manager
- Domain matter expert

As project manager, I ensured client needs were met within a reasonable time frame and the software was able to do what they wanted. 

As domain matter expert, I served as a "translator" between the clients (biologists) and the two software engineers, as the ways/langauge of describing functionality and user needs was very different between the two. For example, a "UI" demonstration was confusing for the client, as much core functionality was still not operational, so it was unclear what they were being asked to provide feedback for.
