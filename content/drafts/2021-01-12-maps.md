Idea:

Use some of the notes on making pretty maps to explore:

- What boundary roads are in Australia, and what they designate?
- What are the most common road names in Australia?
- What are the longest road names in Australia?
- Can I adapt the code to Russian/Moscow?
- Make a map of places I've lived/Nilesh has lived/gone to school
