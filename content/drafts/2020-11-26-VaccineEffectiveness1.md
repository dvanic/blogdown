Vaccine efficacy

How is it measured?

How is the conf int calculated?

IRR stands for incidence rate ratio

The sample vaccine efficacy can be defined as 1 - IRR = 1 - (cv/nv)/(cp/np)
nv/np - subjects in each group
cp/cv - subjects that got the disease 



The press release stated that so far 38955 subjects got the two doses of the vaccine or placebo of which 94 subjects fell ill with Covid-19. Furthermore, the study plan stated that the same number of subjects was assigned to the treatment and control group and letâ€™s assume that also in the 38955 subjects analysed so far the ratio is almost equal. An efficacy of at least 90% then implies that from the 94 subjects with Covid-19 at most 8 could have been vaccinated.
